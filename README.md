I have created this VA project to automate the tasks that will facilitate you from easy browsing to youtube automation and from giving answers to your general queries to more specific ones.A lot more updation is to be.I have used basically one library, some pip packages and some modules.I used selenium library.It is easy to handle and more flexible when it comes to automation.PyAudio is used to play and record audio on multiple platforms including windows,speech_recognition module used for to identify words in spoken language and convert them into text and pyttsx3 for converting text-to-speech using different platforms.Two levels of programming have been covered in this program:

1-Procedural programming(loops,functions,methods etc)

2-OOP(classes)
